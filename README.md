## tips

It’s natural to feel stressed during a test, so don’t panic. We wrote down some good old tips that may calm you down.

- [ ] Relax yourself mentally and physically
- [ ] Consider alternative solutions
- [ ] If you are stuck, start with the brute force solution
- [ ] Plan out the full solution before you code
- [ ] Keep the big picture in mind

# How can I apply for this opportunity?

Fork this repository, build your awesome solution and then add alex.nosse@bornlogic.com and neto@bornlogic.com as collaborators to your project.

Build a greate READ.ME explaining how to run your code and which technologies did you choose.

You can open an issue at any time if you have any questions.

# Let's get started

Let's pretend we launched a "Marvel Comics Catalog", using <a href="https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started" target='_blank'>Marvel API</a>.

Your first objective as a frontend developer is to help us grow our socialmedia by building the first visual components and webpages.

## Development Requirements

### Which technologies/libs can I use?

- React + Redux
- ES6+
- React Hooks
- styled components, postCSS, TailwindCSS, or any other css library.
- You can also use <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/" target='_blank'>create-react-app</a> if you want to.

### What libs/tech should I avoid?

- Structured templates (using an already built template restrain our capacity to evaluate your project)

### Time frame

- Keep Calm, and do as much as you can. Keep in mind that you have up to 7 days to complete the challenge.

## Step One

- [ ] Read carefully the documentation: <a href="https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started" target='_blank'>Marvel API</a>.
- [ ] Create an account and an API key. You can use <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a> or <a href="https://insomnia.rest/download" target="_blank" >Insomnia</a> and test if your key is valid.

## Step Two

It's show time! Remember, build essencial components for each reusable part of your app, such us lists and detail infos.

The application should have two routes:

- Comic's List
- Comic Detail

> ### The Comic's List page should
>
> - [ ] show the first 30 comics on list;
> - [ ] display for each comic the cover image (if it has one) and it's title;
> - [ ] show the details of the comic, when the user clicks on the comic (navigate to the comic details page);
> - [ ] have an search input, where the user can type the name of the comic;
> - [ ] have a pagination

> ### The comic details page should
>
> - [ ] have more details about the comic, like description, variantDescription, format, pageCount, images;
> - [ ] display a list of characters that are associated with this comic;
> - [ ] display a list of creators that are associated with this comic;
> - [ ] display the cover of a magazine, if the user clicks on the comic name;
> - [ ] be shareable, if the user copy and paste the url on another browser, it should open the same page

## Step Three

It would be great to see these libraries being used in your code, but we would love to know what you can suggest for us:

> - Use of styled-componets (https://styled-components.com/)
> - DOM testing (https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
> - Code patterns (https://eslint.org/ and https://prettier.io)
> - Vector Icon Set (https://fontawesome.com/)

And for last but not least, if you think the those first steps were too easy, then you can:

> - [ ] Create a fake login web page using a JWT token strategy (http://jwt.io);
> - [ ] Add a favorite feature, where the user can save on the client side which comics are his/her favorites, and then show only those selected;
> - [ ] e2e testing ❤️;
> - [ ] Surprise us with some awesome feature that we didn't think about;

## Step four

- [ ] Have you finished? So, make your repo private and add alex.nosse@bornlogic.com and neto@bornlogic.com as collaborator.
- [ ] Push your code to your repo, please do not open a PR for the original repository

## Which are the main aspects we'll be evaluating in your code:

- Clean Code
- How you approach the task presented to you
- Layout and CSS
- Componentization
- Responsivity
- How far can you go through the challenge
- Bug count
