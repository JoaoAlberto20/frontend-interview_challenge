## tips
It’s natural to feel stressed during a test, so don’t panic. We wrote down some good old tips that may calm you down.

- [ ] Relax yourself mentally and physically
- [ ] Consider alternative solutions
- [ ] If you are stuck, start with the brute force solution
- [ ] Plan out the full solution before you code
- [ ] Keep the big picture in mind

# How can I apply for this opportunity?

Fork this repository and pull request your solution. 

Build a greate READ.ME explaining how to run your code and which technologies did you choose.

You can open an issue at any time if you have any questions.

# Let's get started 

Let's pretend we launched a "Social Media for Star Wars characters". 

Your first objective as a frontend developer is to help us grow our socialmedia by building the first visual components and webpages.

> Keep Calm, do as much as you can, but keep in mind that you have up to 7 days to complete the challenge.


## Development Requirements

### Which technologies can I use?
- React + Redux
- ES6+
- React Hooks
You can also use this lib <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/" target='_blank'>create-react-app</a> if you want to.

## Step One 
 
Use a wrapper for rest connection to the API (https://swapi.co/documentation). You can use an existed one or create your own.
You must connect and get data from PEOPLE, PLANETS and SPECIES 
 
 ## Step Two
 
Build some essencial components for:

- Display short info of a person
- Display all attributes of a person
- Display all attributes of a planet
- Display all attributes of a species
- List people using infinity scroll
- List people of a planet
- List people of a species
- List all planets without infinity scroll
- List all species without infinity scroll
- Search people by any attribute
- Filter people by planet and species

## Step Three

It's show time! 

Let's connect them all and create the webpages:
 
 - display all people of the social media in a list, filtering and searching
 - click on each people and open details (all attributes) 
 - display all planets
 - click on each planet and open details (all attributes) and show all people vinculated with 
 - display all species
 - click on each species and open details (all attributes) and show all people vinculated with 
 
## Step Four - Final

- There is no avatar in the API database, so, we would like to see how you implement a local storage of avatars.
- Add the capability of changing avatar


It would be great to see these more details of your code, but we would love to hear your proposed list:
- A fake login web page using a JWT token strategy (http://jwt.io)
- Use of styled-componets (https://styled-components.com/)
- DOM testing (https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
- Code patterns (https://eslint.org/ and https://prettier.io)
- Vector Icon Set (https://fontawesome.com/)


## BONUS

- Create a docker image
- Deploy and share it on a cloud service: Azure, Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud Plataform
